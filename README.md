# Kidoju-Feedback

This GitHub project only has the [issues](https://github.com/kidoju/Kidoju-Feedback/issues) section.

The goal is to create a searchable forum of questions and answers and to collect user feedback regarding the use of [Kidoju](https://www.kidoju.com).

## Bugs

A bug is a developped feature that does not work as intended. To be considered as a bug, the defect must be reproducible.

Bugs are classified by priority:

- CRITICAL (Resolution within 24h) = Everyone is prevented from completing an essential use case;
- MAJOR (Resolution in the next version) = Everyone is prevented from completing a non-essential use case or there is an easy workaround.
- MINOR (resolution within a couple of versions)) = Someone is prevented from completing a use case under specific circumstances. The defect does not affect everyone.

Reporting a bug has specific requirements:

- Describe the defect: what is expected, what actuelly occurs.
- Describe the steps to reproduce the defect: do this, do that.
- When user entries are affected, give the data set that one should enter to reproduce the defect.
- Describe your platform (operating system, browser, else).
- When relevant, include screen shots and browser console logs.

## Wishes or Enhancements

A wish or enhancement is a suggestion for a new feature or for improving an existing feature.

Wishes and enhancements are added to a wish list, estimated and prioritised according to:
- Benefit to a large number of users;
- Difficulty/Cost.

## Versioning

Each new version includes the top of the wish list and fixes to the most urgent bugs.
